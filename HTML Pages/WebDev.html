                <h3>Types of web developers</h3>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end
                    developers,
                    and full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as webmasters. Let’s take a closer look
                    at
                    each of these roles.</p>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is
                    visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the
                    website’s
                    performance and capacity. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Back-end web developers:</strong> Create the website’s structure, write code, and
                        verify
                        the code works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others
                        who
                        need to manage a website’s content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Front-end web developers:</strong> Work on the visual part of the website—the pages
                        visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design the physical
                        layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Full-stack developers:</strong> Do the work of both a back-end and front-end
                        developer.
                        These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for
                        organizations
                        that don’t have the budget for a large website team. </li>
                    <li><strong>Webmasters:</strong> Are essentially website managers. Their primary responsibility
                        is
                        to keep the website updated, ensuring that the links and applications on each page work
                        properly.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Web developer tasks and responsibilities</h3>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">As a web developer, you could work for a company or agency, or as a freelancer taking on projects
                    for
                    individual clients. Your tasks will vary depending on your work situation, but day-to-day
                    responsibilities might generally include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing user interfaces and navigation menusDesigning user interfaces and navigation menus
                    </li>
                    <li>Writing and reviewing code for sites, typically HTML, XML, or JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Integrating multimedia content onto a site</li>
                    <li>Testing web applications</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting problems with performance or user experience</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with designers, developers, and stakeholders</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Web developer career path</h3>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">Many web developers start their careers with a single focus, usually front-end or back-end
                    development. They may move on to be full-stack developers or explore careers in related fields,
                    including project management, computer programming, or graphic design. </p>
            </div>

            <div id="How much do web developers make?">
                <h2>How much do web developers make?</h2>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">The median annual salary for web developers in the US is $78,300, according to the Bureau of
                    Labor
                    Statistics (BLS) <a
                        href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-1">[1]</a>.
                    However, web developers in the US can earn up to $249,297 according to Glassdoor salary insights
                    <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/web-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm">[2]</a>.
                    How much you earn will depend on many factors, including where you work, what industry you work
                    in,
                    and how much experience you have.
                </p>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">BLS estimates 23 percent industry growth for web developers between 2021-2031, a
                    faster-than-average
                    rate compared to other occupations.
                    One of the driving forces behind this increase in web development jobs is the growth of
                    e-commerce.
                    Companies are becoming more reliant on functioning websites that operate on multiple devices to
                    do
                    business.</p>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">A Database Administrator (DBA) is responsible for the performance, integrity, and security of a
                    database.
                    They may also be involved in planning and development, as well as troubleshooting any issues on
                    behalf of users.</p>

                <h2>How to become a web developer</h2>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">A formal education isn’t always necessary to become an entry-level web developer. Some web
                    developers
                    have an associate or bachelor’s degree in website design or computer science, but others teach
                    themselves how to code and design websites. While earning a degree can make you a more
                    competitive
                    candidate, a strong portfolio can go a long way toward validating your skills to potential
                    employers.</p>

                <p class="dark-mode-class">If you’re interested in becoming a web developer, here are some steps you can take.</p>
                <h3>1. Build web developer skills.</h3>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">Employers and clients usually expect web developers to have certain skills that demonstrate their
                    ability to deliver on website requirements. If you’re interested in a career as a web developer,
                    these are some skills you can focus on to build a foundation for success.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Coding:</strong> Common programming languages include HTML, PHP, cascading
                                style
                                sheets, and JavaScript for front-end design. Consider learning Python, Java, or Ruby
                                if
                                you want to do back-end development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> People use a variety of devices to view
                                websites.
                                Developers should be able to create sites that look as good on smartphones and
                                tablets
                                as they do on computer screens.</li>
                            <li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> Many factors of website design can affect the site’s
                                search engine ranking. Understanding how search engines rank sites is useful in a
                                developer’s work. </li>
                            <li><strong>Version control:</strong> This lets you track and control changes to the
                                source
                                code without starting over from the beginning each time you run into a problem.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visual design:</strong> Understanding basic design principles, such as how
                                to
                                use white space, choose fonts, and incorporate images could boost your

                        <h3>Workplace skills</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Web developers spend time discussing design ideas
                                with
                                their clients and team members through each step of the project.</li>
                            <li><strong>Customer service:</strong> A web developer creates websites for the client
                                to
                                use and should remain client-focused to achieve the best results.</li>
                            <li><strong>Detail-oriented:</strong> Little details, like a small change in code, can
                                make
                                a big difference in how a website performs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Keeping track of deadlines, project tasks, workflow,
                                and
                                budgets is helpful if you want to complete a website design on time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Problem-solving:</strong> Web developers often run into issues when
                                designing
                                websites. They should have the patience and ability to identify problems in the
                                design
                                or coding and solve them in a methodical way.</li>

                <h3>2. Consider a degree in computer science or web design.</h3>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">While you don’t always need a degree to get a job in web development, it can certainly help. If
                    you’re already in school (or considering earning a degree), some majors might be a better fit
                    for
                    your career goals than others. If you’re more interested in back-end web development, consider a
                    degree program in computer science. If you feel more drawn to front-end development, you might
                    opt
                    for a degree in web design or <a

                        experience (UX)</a>.</p>
                <h3>3. Take a course in web development.</h3>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">You don’t necessarily need formal training to work as a web developer. It’s possible to acquire
                    the
                    skills you need on your own. For example, you can take a course to learn programming languages
                    like
                    HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, and then put what you learn into practice on your own website.</p>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">By completing an online course in web development, like <a
                        href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">Web Design for Everybody: Basics
                        of
                        Web Development & Coding</a> from the University of Michigan, you can build skills while
                    completing development projects for your portfolio.</p>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">Get a feel for what the course is like by watching this video on interactivity with JavaScript:

                <h3>4. Build a portfolio of web development work.</h3>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">As a web developer, your portfolio is often one of the most important parts of your resume. This
                    collection of projects shows potential employers what you’re capable of creating. Include the
                    types
                    of projects that represent the work you’d like to do. If you’re including code, be sure to
                    annotate
                    it to show your thought process.</p>
                <h3>5. Get certified.</h3>
                <p class="dark-mode-class">Earning a certification can validate your skill set to potential employers. You’ll find a range
                    of
                    general and vendor-specific options, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adobe Certified Expert (ACE)</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSD)</li>
